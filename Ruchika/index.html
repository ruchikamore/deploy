    <h2> WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF EARTHQUAKES</h2>
    <p>The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that we feel.An earthquake is caused by a sudden slip on a fault.

      In California there are two plates - the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The Pacific Plate consists of most of the Pacific Ocean floor and the California Coast line. The North American Plate comprises most the North American Continent and parts of the Atlantic Ocean floor. The primary boundary between these two plates is the San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas Fault is more than 650 miles long and extends to depths of at least 10 miles. Many other smaller faults like the Hayward (Northern California) and the San Jacinto (Southern California) branch from and join the San Andreas Fault Zone.
      
      The Pacific Plate grinds northwestward past the North American Plate at a rate of about two inches per year. Parts of the San Andreas Fault system adapt to this movement by constant "creep" resulting in many tiny shocks and a few moderate earth tremors. In other areas where creep is NOT constant, strain can build up for hundreds of years, producing great earthquakes when it finally releases.</p>

    <h2>What to do when earthquakes occurs</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Get under a desk or table and hang on to it (Drop, Cover, and Hold on!) or move into a hallway or against an inside wall.</li>
      <li> STAY CLEAR of windows, fireplaces, and heavy furniture or appliances.</li>
      <li>GET OUT of the kitchen, which is a dangerous place (things can fall on you)Drop, Cover and Hold under a desk or table. If there's no table around, find the nearest safe place beside an inside wall or lower than furnishings.</li>
      <li>If outside and in an open area, sit down and cover your head with your arms. If in “the danger zone”, next to building, try to get back into the building for shelter.</li>
